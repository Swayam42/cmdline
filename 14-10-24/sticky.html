<p>Diwali, also known as ‘Deepavali’ (a row of lamps), is one of the most fervently celebrated festivals of India. Diwali is often called the ‘Festival of Lights’, and is celebrated by lighting lamps, and bursting crackers and fireworks. It is a festival which commemorates the victorious return of Lord Rama to Ayodhya after saving his wife Sita from the demon king Ravana. This religious festival represents the triumph of good over evil and light over darkness.

People all over India celebrate Diwali by lighting earthen oil lamps and decorating their houses with lights of different colours and sizes. All these lights transform streets across India into a mesmerising sight to behold. Kids celebrate the occasion by bursting crackers and different fireworks like sparklers, rockets, flower pots, fountains, peony fireworks, etc.

Diwali falls on the 20th day after the festival of Dussehra, usually in October or November every year. Families and friends visit each other, exchange gifts, and share delicious food to celebrate the occasion. Goddess Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, is also worshipped on the occasion.

In recent years, the use of crackers and fireworks has come down dramatically as it contributes to air pollution and noise pollution, especially in cities where you hear a cracker bursting every other second. There are also safety issues concerning the use of fireworks, especially by children. So let us celebrate this festival of lights with more care and responsibility.”
